# vega-network-map

## Overview

This project leverages Vega to build a dynamic network map visualization within Kibana. It provides an interactive way to visualize network devices, their connections, and the health status of each element. The visualization also automatically organizes devices into network zones if the corresponding zone parameter is filled in for each device.
